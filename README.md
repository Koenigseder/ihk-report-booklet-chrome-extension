# IHK report booklet Chrome extension

This Chrome extension is a little helper when using the IHK report booklet (<https://bildung.ihk.de>).

As a user of the IHK tool you have to note down your doings of the day and select for every bullet point various qualifications. It is not rare that you select the same qualifications for different doings and clicking through each and every qualification for each doing can be really tidious and time consuming.

Since the IHK tool doesn't offer some kind of grouping option for those qualifications (to select multiple at once), this little extension can help you with that.

# How to use it

**NOTE**: This tool is only available in German. The reason for that is that the IHK tool is a German tool with no intention for support of other languages.

1. Click on the extension and click on "Gruppen bearbeiten"
2. Click on "Neue Gruppe erstellen"
3. Type in a new group name
4. Type into the input field below the beginning of a qualification and click on the "Add" icon on the right side
   - **IMPORTANT**: It is important that you are careful with the input. The extension matches always the beginning of the qualifications and your input. To make sure the right qualifications get selected, paste in the complete expression. E.g. instead of just "Entwickeln" paste in "Entwickeln, Erstellen und Betreuen von IT-LÃ¶sungen".
     Watch out for typos.
5. After you added all your qualifications to the list hit "Speichern"
6. Reload the IHK tool and click on the qualifications button. Now there is a new popup with the groups you defined

You can always edit and delete your groups as you want.

## Privacy Policy

This extension does not collect any user data and does not share any data with anyone. Not with the developers, not with other users or with other third parties.
The user can create groups of qualifications which are stored 100% locally within the browser.
